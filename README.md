# LocalWisp
LocalWisp is an offline voice dictation utility for Windows. It captures audio while a hotkey is held and types the transcription directly into the active text field upon release. The tool is built for CPU-based inference and is currently configured for the performance profile of an 8-core processor, specifically tested on a Ryzen 7 5700G.
